                                    System X PRO provides a high gloss, this is our most popular coating. Diamond
                                    Hardcoat does not provide as much gloss, but will last longer than PRO and is easily
                                    layered. Diamond Hardcoat is great for marine applications, around aircraft exhaust
                                    ports, and bare metal applications like stainless steel. If you desire both the
                                    added protection of Diamond Hardcoat and the high gloss of PRO you can apply Diamond
                                    Hardcoat as a basecoat first, then after 30 minutes of drying apply a layer of PRO.
                                    Both these products provide outstanding protection and are only sold by the case to

                                <p class="txtPage">Yes, System X Resin should be thought of as adding another clear coat
                                    to the paints surface. This new clear coat is glossier, chemical resistant, and
                                    harder than the original clear coat. System X is a permanent coating in the same

                                <p class="txtPage">System X provides additional gloss and protection over clear coats.
                                    The ceramic resin bonded coating helps contaminants slide off easily, which give
                                    them less time to eat into the surface. An added plus is the ease of cleaning your
                                    vehicle. An easy way to think of it would be that System X is the equivalent of
                                    another, harder and glossier clear coat layer.</p>
